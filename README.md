# K9s - Kubernetes CLI To Manage Your Clusters In Style!

K9s provides a curses based terminal UI to interact with your Kubernetes clusters.
The aim of this project is to make it easier to navigate, observe and manage
your applications. This command line app continually watches Kubernetes
for changes and offers subsequent commands to interact with observed resources.

## Known Issues...

This initial drop is brittle. k9s will most likely blow up if...

+ Your kube-config file does not live under $HOME/.kube or you use multiple configs
+ You don't have enough RBAC fu to manage your cluster
+ Your cluster does not run a metrics-server
