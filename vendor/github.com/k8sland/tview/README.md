This Go package provides commonly needed components for terminal based user interfaces.

Among these components are:

- __Input forms__ (include __input/password fields__, __drop-down selections__, __checkboxes__, and __buttons__)
- Navigable multi-color __text views__
- Sophisticated navigable __table views__
- Flexible __tree views__
- Selectable __lists__
- __Grid__, __Flexbox__ and __page layouts__
- Modal __message windows__
- An __application__ wrapper

They come with lots of customization options and can be easily extended to fit your needs.

## Installation

```bash
go get github.com/rivo/tview
```

## Hello World

This basic example creates a box titled "Hello, World!" and displays it in your terminal:

```go
package main

import (
	"github.com/k8sland/tview"
)

func main() {
	box := tview.NewBox().SetBorder(true).SetTitle("Hello, world!")
	if err := tview.NewApplication().SetRoot(box, true).Run(); err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}
}
```
