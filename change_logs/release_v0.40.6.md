# Release v0.40.6

## Notes

Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues and enhancements for K9s!
I'll try to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest rev
and see if we're happier with some of the fixes!
If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close.

Your support, kindness and awesome suggestions to make K9s better are, as ever, very much noted and appreciated!
Also big thanks to all that have allocated their own time to help others on both slack and on this repo!!

## Maintenance Release!

### Breaking change

Moved `portForwardAddress` out of clusterXXX/contextYYY/config.yaml and into the main K9s config file.
This is a global preference based on your setup vs a cluster/context specific attribute.
K9s will nag you in the logs if a specific context config still contains this attribute but should not prevent the configuration load.

### Column Blow Reloaded!

We've added another property to the custom view. You can now also specify namespace specific column definition for a given resource.
For instance, view pods in any namespace using one configuration and view pods in `fred` namespace using an alternate configuration.

```yaml
# views.yaml
views:
  # Using this for all pods...
  v1/pods:
    columns:
      - AGE
      - NAMESPACE|WR                                     # => ðŸŒš Specifies the NAMESPACE column to be right aligned and only visible while in wide mode
      - ZORG:.metadata.labels.fred\.io\.kubernetes\.blee # => ðŸŒš extract fred.io.kubernetes.blee label into it's own column
      - BLEE:.metadata.annotations.blee|R                # => ðŸŒš extract annotation blee into it's own column and right align it
      - NAME
      - IP
      - NODE
      - STATUS
      - READY
      - MEM/RL|S                                         # => ðŸŒš Overrides std resource default wide attribute via `S` for `Show`
      - '%MEM/R|'                                        # => NOTE! column names with non alpha names need to be quoted as columns must be strings!

   # Use this instead for pods in namespace `fred`
   v1/pods@fred:                                         # => ðŸŒš New v0.40.6! Customize columns for a given resource and namespace!
    columns:
      - AGE
      - NAMESPACE|WR
```

Additionally, we've added a new column attribute aka `Show` -> `S`. This allows you to now override the default resource column `wide` attribute when set.
