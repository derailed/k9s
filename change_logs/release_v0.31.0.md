## Feature Release!

ðŸ˜³ Found a few issues in the neutrino drive...
This is another fairly heavy drop so bracing for impact ðŸ˜±
Be sure to dial in the v0.31.0 SneakPeek video below for the gory details!

ðŸ˜µ Hopefully we've move the needle in the right direction on this drop... ðŸ¤ž

Thank you all for your kindness, feedback and assistance in flushing out issues!!

### Hold My Hand...

In this drop, we've added schema validation to ensure various configs are setup as expected.
K9s will now run validation checks on the following configurations:

1. K9s main configuration (config.yaml)
2. Context specific configs (clusterX/contextY/config.yaml)
3. Skins
4. Aliases
5. HotKeys
6. Plugins
7. Views

K9s behavior changed in this release if the main configuration does not match schema expectations.
In the past, the configuration will be validated, updated and saved should validation checks failed. Now the app will stop and report validation issues.

The schemas are set to be a bit loose for the time being. Once we/ve vetted they are cool, we could publish them out (with additional TLC!) so k9s users can leverage them in their favorite editors.

In the meantime, you'll need to keep k9s logs handy, to check for validation errors. The validation messages can be somewhat cryptic at times and so please be sure to include your debug logs and config settings when reporting issues which might be plenty ;(.

### Breaking Bad!

Configuration changes:

1. DRY fullScreenLogs -> fullScreens (k9s root config.yaml)

   ```yaml
   #  $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml
   k9s:
     liveViewAutoRefresh: false
     logger:
       sinceSeconds: -1
       fullScreen: false # => Was fullScreenLogs
     ...
   ```

2. Views Configuration.
   To match other configurations the root is now `views:` vs `k9s: views:`

   ```yaml
   # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/views.yaml
   views: # => Was k9s:\n  views:
    v1/pods:
      columns:
        - AGE
        - NAMESPACE
        ...
   ```

### Serenity Now!

   You can now opt in/out of the `reactive ui` feature. This feature enable users to make change to some configurations and see changes reflected live in the ui. This feature is now disabled by default and one must opt-in to enable via `k9s.UI.reactive`
   Reactive UI provides for monitoring various config files on disk and update the UI when changes to those files occur. This is handy while tuning skins, plugins, aliases, hotkeys and benchmarks parameters.

   ```yaml
   # $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/k9s/config.yaml
   k9s:
     liveViewAutoRefresh: false
     UI:
       ...
       reactive: true # => enable/disable reactive UI
     ...
   ```
