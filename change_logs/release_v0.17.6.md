## Get A Rope!

This was in the backlogs for a while, so I've decided to give it a bit of TLC. Thank you [Mitchell Maler](https://github.com/mitchellmaler) for this issue!

🏝Feeling your clusters could use a bit of spring cleaning 🧽🧼?
As of this drop, you can now perform direct cluster nodes maintenance by leveraging cordon `c`, uncordon `u` and drain `d` while in node view! Each operation comes with a dialog to either configure the options or comfirm the operation. You dig?
