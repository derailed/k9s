## PersistentVolumeClaims Reference Tracking

In continuation with the resource usage check feature added in v0.20, we've added reference checks on the PVC view. If you ever wonder which resources on your cluster are referencing a given PVC, simply press `u` for `UsedBy` and k9s will tell you.

## New Config On The Block

Some folks voiced concerns with K9s config dir littering their home directory with yet another `.dir`. In this drop, we're introducing a new env variable `K9SCONFIG` that tells K9s where to look for its configurations. If `K9SCONFIG` is not set K9s will look in the usual place aka `$HOME/.k9s`.
