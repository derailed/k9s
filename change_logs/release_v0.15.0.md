## Seen This Fez Before?

The awesome and ever so smart and creative [Alex Ellis](https://github.com/alexellis) of [OpenFaas Fame](https://www.openfaas.com) fame, had pinged me when I had launched K9s to add support for OpenFaas functions. It's been a long time coming indeed, but we now have a very (VERY!) primitive integration with this very cool framework.

The current approach is to enable a few environment variables to tell K9s that you have an OpenFaas cluster available namely:

```shell
OPENFAAS_GATEWAY=http://YOUR_CLUSTER_IP:31112
OPENFAAS_TLS_INSECURE=false
OPENFAAS_JWT_TOKEN=YOUR_TOKEN
```

These will tell K9s that an OpenFaas gateway is available and exposed on a given nodeport.

Next you can navigate to your OpenFaas function view by entering command mode `:openfaas` or using aliases `:ofaas` or `ofa`

If functions are present in the given namespace they will be displayed here just like any other K8s resources.

The following operations are currently supported:

* Describe and YAML to view function definitions (Note: currently yields same results!)
* Enter to view all pods instances associated with the selected function
* Delete a function
* Editing, shelling, logs, etc... are all supported by navigating to the underlying pods

Keep in mind, the paint is way fresh here and this feature could be a complete dud, but figure will give it a rinse on this drop and Alex can pipe in and helps us ironing this out.

> NOTE! It's been a while since I've played with OpenFaas so if some of you are more versed in this space by all means please do land a hand so we can make this feature more awesome!

## Moving Forward!

A few folks had mentioned the eagerness to port-forward directly from a pod or a service. Well now you can! Port Forwarding is now available on both the pod view and services view. Note! at the end of the day, you are still port-forwarding to a container! So the port-forward dialog is a bit different for these views as there might be several container ports available now when looking at this from a pod perspective. So the first field in the dialog is a combo-box that allows one to pick their desired ports. The rest of the dialog works the same as the container port-forward dialog.
