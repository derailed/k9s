# Release v0.31.8

## Notes

Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues and enhancements for K9s!
I'll try to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest rev
and see if we're happier with some of the fixes!
If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close.

Your support, kindness and awesome suggestions to make K9s better are, as ever, very much noted and appreciated!
Also big thanks to all that have allocated their own time to help others on both slack and on this repo!!

As you may know, K9s is not pimped out by corps with deep pockets, thus if you feel K9s is helping your Kubernetes journey,
please consider joining our [sponsorship program](https://github.com/sponsors/derailed) and/or make some noise on social! [@kitesurfer](https://twitter.com/kitesurfer)

On Slack? Please join us [K9slackers](https://join.slack.com/t/k9sers/shared_invite/enQtOTA5MDEyNzI5MTU0LWQ1ZGI3MzliYzZhZWEyNzYxYzA3NjE0YTk1YmFmNzViZjIyNzhkZGI0MmJjYzhlNjdlMGJhYzE2ZGU1NjkyNTM)

## Maintenance Release!

Thank you all for pitching in and helping flesh out issues!!

Please make sure to add gory details to issues ie relevant configs, debug logs, etc...

Comments like: `same here!` or `me to!` doesn't really cut it for us to zero in ;(
Everyone has slightly different settings/platforms so every little bits of info helps with the resolves even if seemingly irrelevant.
