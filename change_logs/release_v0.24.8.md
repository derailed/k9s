## Maintenance Release!

### NodeShell args

In this drop, we've added additional configurations to the k9s node shell so you override the command and args on the node shell containers.

```yaml
    # $HOME/.k9s/config.yml
    ...
    minikube:
      view:
        active: pod
      featureGates:
        nodeShell: true
      shellPod:
        image: busybox:1.31
        # New!
        command: ["/bin/sh", "-c"]
        # New!
        args: ["ls -al"]
        namespace: default
        limits:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
     ...
```
