## Disruption In The Force

During this drop, I've gotten totally slammed by other forces ;( I've had so many disruptions that affected my `quasi` normal flow hence this drop might be a bit wonky ;( So please proceed with caution!!

As always please help me flush/report issues and I'll address them promptly! Thank you so much for your understanding and patience!! üôèüë®‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüë®üòç

## Improved Node Shell Usability

In this drop we've changed the configuration of the node shell action that let's you shell into nodes. Big thanks to [Patrick Decat](https://github.com/pdecat) for helping us flesh out this beta feature! We've added configuration to not only customize the image but also the resources and namespace on how to run these K9s pods on your clusters. The new configuration is set at the cluster scope level.

Here is an example of the new pod shell config options:

```yaml
# $HOME/.k9s/config.yml
k9s:
  clusters:
    blee:
      featureGates:
        # You must enable the nodeShell feature gate to enable shelling into nodes
        nodeShell: true
      # NEW! You can now tune the pod specification: currently image, namespace and resources
      shellPod:
        image: cool_kid_admin:42
        namespace: blee
        limits:
          cpu: 100m
          memory: 100Mi
```
