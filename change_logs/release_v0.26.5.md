## Maintenance Release

So it looks like replacing the clipboard package was indeed a dud ;(
While I was not keen on either running with cgo or taking on external dependencies, after further investigation it looks like the clipboard + wsl issue in the old package was [resolved](https://github.com/atotto/clipboard/pull/42). I don't run WSL so I can't test it but if that's not the case please reopen and we will figure out another solution. For the time being, I've opted for the reversal.
Thank you!!
