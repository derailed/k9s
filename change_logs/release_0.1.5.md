## Notes

Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues with K9s! I'll try
to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest
rev and see if we're happier with some of the fixes!

If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close.

Thank you so much for your support!!
