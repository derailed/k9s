# Release v0.50.15

## Notes

Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues and enhancements for K9s!
I'll try to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest rev
and see if we're happier with some of the fixes!
If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close.

Your support, kindness and awesome suggestions to make K9s better are, as ever, very much noted and appreciated!
Also big thanks to all that have allocated their own time to help others on both slack and on this repo!!

As you may know, K9s is not pimped out by big corporations with deep pockets, thus if you feel K9s is helping in your Kubernetes journey, please consider joining our [sponsorship program](https://github.com/sponsors/derailed) and/or make some noise on social!

## Maintenance Release!

Sponsorships are dropping at an alarming rate which puts this project in the red. This is becoming a concern and sad not to mention unsustainable ;( If you dig `k9s` and want to help the project, please consider `paying it forward!` and don't become just another `satisfied, non paying customer!`. K9s does take a lot of my `free` time to maintain, enhance and keep the light on. Many cool ideas are making it straight to the `freezer` as I just can't budget them in.
I know many of you work for big corporations, so please put in the word/work and have them help us out via sponsorships or other means.

Thank you!
