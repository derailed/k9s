Maintenance Release!

## A Word From Our Sponsors...

First off, I would like to send a `Big Thank You` to the following generous K9s friends for joining our sponsorship program and supporting this project!

* [Martin Kemp](https://github.com/MartiUK)

Contrarily to popular belief, OSS is not free! We've now reached ~9k stars and 300k downloads! As you all know, this project is not pimped out by a big company with deep pockets and a large team. K9s is complex and does demand a lot of my time. So if this tool is useful to you and part of your daily lifecycle, please contribute! Your contribution whether financial, PRs, issues or shout-outs on social/blogs are crucial to keep K9s growing and powerful for all of us. Don't let OSS by individual contributors become an oxymoron!

## I Should've known better

Seems like I've broken the golden rule ie never add a feature without providing an option to turn it off ;( It looks like enable mouse support for K9s had unexpected side effects. So in this drop, we're introducing a new configuration aka `enableMouse` that defaults to `false`. You can opt-in mouse support, by enabling it in the K9s config file. That said when mouse support is enabled, you can still use terminal selection using either `Shift/Option` for Windows/Mac.

```yaml
# $HOME/.k9s/config.yml
k9s:
  refreshRate: 2
  enableMouse: true # Defaults to false if not set
  headless: false
  ...
```
