## Thresholds Reloaded!

In the previous k9s release, we've introduced the notion of thresholds to provide with an alert mechanism when either the cpu or memory goes high on your clusters. Looking at the current solution, we felt we needed a bit more granularity in the severity levels thanks to [Eldad Assis](https://github.com/eldada) feedback on this one! So here is the new configuration for cluster thresholds. Please keep in mind this feature is still in flux!

```yaml
# $HOME/.k9s/config.yml
k9s:
  refreshRate: 2
  headerless: false
  ...
  # Specify resources thresholds in percent - defaults: critical=90, warn=70
  thresholds:
    cpu:
      critical: 85
      warn: 75
    memory:
      critical: 80
      warn: 70
  ...
```
