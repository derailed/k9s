## First A Word From Our Sponsors...

First off, I would like to send a `Big Thank You` to the following generous K9s friends for joining our sponsorship program and supporting this project!

* [Remo Eichenberger](https://github.com/remoe)
* [Ken Ahrens](https://github.com/kenahrens)

## Moving Forward!

In this drop, we've added a port-forward indicator to visually see if a port-forward is active on a pod/container. You can also navigate directly to the port-forward view using the new shortcut `f` available in
pod and container view.

## Manifest That!

Ever wanted to manipulate your Kubernetes manifests directly in K9s? `Yes Please!!`

We are introducing a new view namely `directory` aka `dir`. Using this command you can list/traverse a given directory structure containing your Kubernetes manifests using a new `:dir /fred` command.
From there you can view/edit your manifests and also deploy or delete these resources for your cluster directly from K9s. Just like `kubectl` you can apply/delete an entire directory or a single manifest.
How cool is that?
