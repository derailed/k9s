# Release v0.51

## Notes

Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues and enhancements for K9s!
I'll try to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest rev
and see if we're happier with some of the fixes!
If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close.

Your support, kindness and awesome suggestions to make K9s better are, as ever, very much noted and appreciated!
Also big thanks to all that have allocated their own time to help others on both slack and on this repo!!

## 5-0, 5-0 HotFix!

It looks like we've broken a few things in the clean up process üò≥
Apologizes for the `disruption in the farce`. Hopefully happier on v0.50.1...
Crossing fingers and toes!

‚ò†Ô∏è Careful on this upgrade! üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
We've gone thru lots of code revamp/refactor in the v0.50.0, so mileage may vary...
