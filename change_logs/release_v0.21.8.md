## A Word From Our Sponsors...

First off, I would like to send a `Big Thank You` to the following generous K9s friends for joining our sponsorship program and supporting this project!

* [Jean-Luc Geering](https://github.com/jlgeering)
* [Takafumi Ikeda](https://github.com/ikeike443)

Contrarily to popular belief, OSS is not free! We've now reached ~9k stars and 300k downloads! As you all know, this project is not pimped out by a big company with deep pockets and a large team. K9s is complex and does demand a lot of my time. So if this tool is useful to you and part of your daily lifecycle, please contribute! Your contribution whether financial, PRs, issues or shout-outs on social/blogs are crucial to keep K9s growing and powerful for all of us. Don't let OSS by individual contributors become an oxymoron!
