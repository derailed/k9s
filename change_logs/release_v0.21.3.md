## ♫ The Sound Behind The Release ♭

And now for something a `beat` different?

I figured, why not share one of the tunes I was spinning when powering thru teh bugs? Might as well share the pain/pleasure right?

[Funkin' for Jamaica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuUy2ShGLyo) by the most awesome Tom Browne!

Lots of bugs fix in this drop and perf improvements...

NOTE! You may experience some disturbance in the force in this drop, so please proceed with caution and do land a hand flushing out potential issues.
