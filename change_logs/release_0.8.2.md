## Change Logs

Maintenance release.

In this quick drop, we've opted to nuke any menu shortcut using the infamous `Alt` key. This includes the new pod kill command that is now `Ctrl-K` and for the most part the column sorting shortcuts for CPU% and MEMORY%. My apologizes to all on this fiasco as it turns out I had remapped opt->alt on my local dev machine and space it while trying to offer different key mappings. Will revisit this in the future when things simmer down a bit. Thank you to all that reported on this!
