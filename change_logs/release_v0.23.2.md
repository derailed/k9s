### Write Mode

K9s is writable by default, meaning you can interact with your cluster and make changes using one shot commands ie edit, delete, scale, etc... There `readOnly` config option that can be specified in the configuration or via a cli arg to override this behavior. In this drop, we're introducing a symmetrical command line arg aka `--write` that overrides a K9s session and make it writable tho the readOnly config option is set to true.

## Inverse Log Filtering

In the last drop, we've introduces reverse filters to filter out resources from table views. Now you will be able to apply inverse filtering on your log views as well via `/!fred`
