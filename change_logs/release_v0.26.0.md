Thank you to all that contributed with flushing out issues and enhancements for K9s! I'll try to mark some of these issues as fixed. But if you don't mind grab the latest rev and see if we're happier with some of the fixes! If you've filed an issue please help me verify and close. Your support, kindness and awesome suggestions to make K9s better are as ever very much noted and appreciated! Also big thanks to all that have allocated their own time to help others on both slack and on this repo!!

## Maintenance Release

Please join me in giving a big THANK YOU and ATTA BOY!! to [Aleksei Romanenko](https://github.com/slimus) for allocating his personal time in helping out his fellow K9ser's with issues, PRs and slack!!

Also in the last drop, I'd updated k8s API's to the latest which caused some `disturbance in the farce!` and hosed AWS cluster connections in the same swop ;( Please see [Issue#119](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/issues/1619) for `a` resolve... I did not catch it early enough hence the release bump on this drop. My bad!!
