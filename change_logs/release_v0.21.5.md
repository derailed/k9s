## First A Word From Our Sponsors...

First off, I would like to send a `Big Thank You` to the following generous K9s friends for joining our sponsorship program and supporting this project!

* [Drew](https://github.com/ScubaDrew)
* [Vladimir Rybas](https://github.com/vrybas)

Contrarily to popular belief, OSS is not free! We've now reached 8k stars and 270k downloads! As you all know, this project is not pimped out by a big company with deep pockets or a large team. This project is complex and does demand a lot of my time. So if k9s is useful to you and part of your daily lifecycle. Please contribute! Your contribution whether financial, PRs, issues or shout-outs on social/blogs are crucial to keep K9s growing and powerful for all of us!
Don't let OSS by individual contributors become an oxymoron...

## New Skins On The Block!

In this drop, big thanks are in effect for [Dan Mikita](https://github.com/danmikita) for contributing a new K9s [solarized theme](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/tree/master/skins)!

Also we've added a new skin configuration for table's cursor namely `cursorFgColor` and `cursorBgColor`:

```yaml
  # skin.yml
  ...
  views:
    table:
      fgColor: *foreground
      bgColor: *background
      cursorFgColor: *foreground
      cursorBgColor: *current_line
      header:
        fgColor: white
        bgColor: *background
        sorterColor: *cyan
  ...
```
