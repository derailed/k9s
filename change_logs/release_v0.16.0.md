This is one of these drops that may make you wonder if you'll go from zero to hero or likely the reverse?? Will see how this goes... Please proceed with caution on this one as there could very well be much disturbances in the force...

Lots of code churns so could have totally hose some stuff, but like my GranPappy used to say `can't cook without making a mess!`

## Going Wide?

In this drop, we've enabled a new shortcut namely `wide` as `Ctrl-w`. On table views, you will be able to see more information about the resources such as labels or others depending on the viewed resource. This mnemonic works as a toggle so you can `narrow` the view by hitting it again.

## Zoom, Zoom, Zoom!

While viewing some resources that may contain errors, sorting on columns may not achieve the results you're seeking ie `show me all resources in an error state`. We've added a new option to achieve just that aka `zoom errors` as `ctrl-z`. This works as a toggle and will unveil resources that are need of some TLC on your part ;)

## Does Your Cluster Have A Pulse ðŸ’“?

In this drop, we're introducing a brand new view aka `K9s Pulses` ðŸ’“. This is a summary view listing the most salient resources in your clusters and their current states. This view tracks two main metrics ie Ok and Toast on a 5sec beat. This view affords cluster activity and failure rates. BTW this is the zero to hero deal ðŸ™€ Hopefully you'll dig it as this was much work to put together and I personally think it's the `ducks nuts`... If you like, please give me some luving on social or via GH sponsors as batteries are running low...

To active, enter command mode by typing in `:pulse` aliases are `pu`, `pulses` or `hz`
To navigate thru the various pulses, you can use `tab`/`backtab` or use the menu index (just like namespaces selectors). Once on a pulse view, you can press `enter` to see the associated resource table view. Pressing `esc` will nav you back.

As I've may have mentioned before, my front-end/UX FU is weak, so I've also added a way for you to skin the charts via skins yaml to your own liking. Please see the skin section below for an example on how to skin the pulses dials. BONUS you should be able to skin K9s live! How cool is that ðŸ˜»?

NOTE: Pulses are very much experimental and could totally bomb on your clusters! So please thread carefully and please do report (kindly!) back.

## BReaking Bad!

In this drop I've broken a few things (that I know off...), here is the list as I can recall...

1. Toggle header aka `my red headed step child`. Key moved (again!) now `Ctrl-e`
2. Skin yaml layout CHANGED! Moved table and xray sections under views and added charts section.

## Skins Updates!

The skin file format CHANGE! If you are running skins with K9s, please make sure to update your skin file. If not K9s could bomb coming up!

NOTE: I don't think I'll get around to update all the contributed skins in this repo `skins` dir. If you're looking for a way to help out and are UI inclined, please take a peek and make them cool!
