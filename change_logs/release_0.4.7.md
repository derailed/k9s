## Change Logs

### Popeye Support

Managing and operating a cluster is the wild is hard and getting harder.
I've created [Popeye](https://github.com/derailed/popeye) to help with cluster sanitation and best practices. Since K9s folks are so awesome, you're getting a sneak peek! I figured why not integrate it with K9s? No need to install yet another CLI right? Provided I did not mess this up too much, you should now be able to use command mod `:popeye` to access Popeye sanitizer reports within
K9s and scan your clusters. You can read more about it [here](https://medium.com/@fernand.galiana/k8s-clusters-oh-biff-em-popeye-637e9312963)
and if you like so give it a clap or two ;)

NOTE: In a K9s environment, if you'd like to specify a spinach config file, you must set it in your $HOME/.k9s/spinach.yml.

NOTE: There is a bit more that need to be done on this integration to be complete. Please file an issue if something does not work as expected.

NOTE: Popeye will run its own course and K9s is just a viewer for it, so if you'd like additional sanitation or find Popeye related issues, please tune to the corresponding repo!

Let us know if you dig it? And share your before/after clusters scores!
