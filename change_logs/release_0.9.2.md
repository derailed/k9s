## Change Logs

I am absolutely blown away by your support and excitement about K9s! As I can recall, this is the first drop since we've launched K9s
back in January 2019 that I've seen some many external contributions and PRs. Thank you!! This is both super exciting and humbling.

### Core +1

As you may have noticed, there is a new voice on the project. [Gustavo Silva Paiva](https://github.com/paivagustavo) kindly accepted to become a K9s core member. Gustavo has been following and contributing to K9s for a while now and have patiently plowed thru my code ;( Raising issues, fixing them, improving code and test coverage, he has demonstrated a genuine interest on making sure K9s is better for all of us.

Actually, I can say enough about Gustavo since I don't know him that well yet ;) But I can tell from my interactions with him that he is a great human being, smart, kind and consensus and hence an awesome K9s addition. Please help me in welcoming him to the K9s pac!

### Breaking Bad

There was an issue with the header toggle mnemonic `Ctrl-H` and it has been changed in this release to just `h`. Thank you for the heads up [Swe Covis](https://github.com/swe-covis)!!
