### XRay Reloaded?

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/derailed/k9s/master/assets/k9s_xray.png"/>

In the last release excitement, forgot to link the video update. Check it out! [K9s Xray](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qaeR2iK7U0o). Yup, got a cold... The joy of transports on the flying Petri dishes we call airplanes ;(

Based on some reported issues, decided to axe the xray icons in this drop for portability sake and also added support for replicasets. So here is the official list of supported Xray resources.

1. Deployments
2. Services
3. StatefulSets
4. DaemonSets
5. ReplicaSets (New!)

Still work in progress... so please proceed with caution!
