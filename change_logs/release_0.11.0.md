## Change Logs

### Anyone At The Helm?

K9s now offers preliminary support for Helm 3 charts! It's been a long time coming and I know a few early users had mentioned the need, but I wanted to see where Helm3 was going first. This is a preview release to see how we fair in Helm land. Besides managing your installed charts, you will be able to perform the following operations:

* Uninstall a chart
* View chart release notes
* View deployed manifests

#### How to use?

Simply enter `:charts` K9s alias command to view the deployed Helm3 charts on your cluster.

If you're using Helm3 in your current clusters, please give it a rip and also pipe in for potential features/enhancements. Mind the gap here as the paint on this feature is totally fresh...

### Bring Out Your Deads...

There are also a few bugs fixes from the refactor aftermath that made this drop. I know this was a bit of a brutal transition, so thank you all for your patience and for filing issues! I am hopeful that K9s will stabilize quickly so we can move on to bigger things.
