## ðŸŽ‰ Feature Release code name: Colon Blow! ðŸŽˆ

We are pretty stocked about this drop (hopefully...) as we've fully enabled custom columns support in K9s!
Historically, one could customize the view for a given resource by adding a definition in `views.yaml`.
From there one could change sort order and re-arrange the standard column layout.
Several folks voiced the need to add a column for a given label/annotation or any other fields available on a resource.
To date, this wasn't possible ðŸ˜³

So... without further ado, let see what we can now do with `Custom Views` ding dang deal!
It all starts with a few new directives available in `views.yaml`

### A Refresher...

Customize a pod view and ensure age, ns and name appear first and sort by age descending.

> NOTE! You no longer need to list out all columns.
> The remaining columns will be automatically filled from the standard columns.

```yaml
# Usual biz...
views:
  v1/pods:                         # specify the gvr you want to customize aka group/version/resource
    sortColumn: AGE:desc           # set the default ordering to ascending (asc) or descending (desc)
    columns:                       # tell the view which columns to display and in which order
      - AGE                        # ensure age, ns and name are the first 3 cols and backfill the rest
      - NAMESPACE
      - NAME
      - READY|H                    # => NEW! Do not display the READY column
      - NODE|W                     # => NEW! Show node column only on wide
      - IP|WR                      # => NEW! Pull the ip column and right align it in wide mode only
```

## Colon Blow!

Say your pods comes standard with a label `blee` and you want to show it while in pod view.

```yaml
# Pull labels/annotations
views:
  v3/freds:
    sortColumn: NAMESPACE:dsc
    columns:
      - NAMESPACE
      - NAME
      - BLEE:.metadata.labels.blee                        # => NEW! Pull values from a label or an annotation using json parser
                                                          # expression similar mechanic as kubectl -o custom-columns
      - ZORG:.spec.zips[?(@.type == 'zorg')].ip|WR        # => NEW! Same deal with a json exp + but align right and show wide only
```

## TLDR...

As you can see the CustomView feature adds a few new semantics on this drop.

You can now use the following shape for columns definition `COL_NAME<:json_parse_expression><|column attributes>`

The `:json_parse_expression` is optional.

The column attributes are as follows:

* `T` -> time column indicator
* `N` -> number column indicator
* `W` -> turns on wide column aka only shows while in wide mode. Defaults to the standard resource definition when present.
* `H` -> Hides the column
* `L` -> Left align (default)
* `R` -> Right align

When certain columns are not present in the custom view, K9s will pull the standard column definition and merge the columns.
This allows user to specify and order which columns they want to see first without having to define every single columns from the default resource representation. If you do not wish to see all these columns you can add them to your custom view definition and either specify `|W` or `|H` to `wide` it or `hide` it.

> ðŸ“¢ Still work in progress so your mileage may vary!
> This feature will likely need additional TLC.
> Your feedback on this will be much appreciated and we will iterate as usual to ensure it vorks as prescribed... ðŸ™€
