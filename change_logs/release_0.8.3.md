## Change Logs

### NetworkPolicy

NetworkPolicy resource is now available under the command `np` while in command mode. It behaves like other K9s resource view. You will get a bit more information in K9s vs `kubectl` as it includes information about ingress and egress rules.

### Arrrggg! New CLI Argument

There is a new K9s command option available on the CLI that affords for launching K9s with a given resource. For example using `k9s -c svc` will launch K9s with a preloaded service view. You can use the same aliases as you would while in K9s to navigate a resources. For all supports resource aliases please view the `Alias View` using `Ctrl-A`.

### CRDS!

We've beefed up CRD support to allow users to navigate to the CRD instances view more readily. So you can now navigate between CRD schema and CRD instances by just hitting `ENTER` while in the `crd` view.
