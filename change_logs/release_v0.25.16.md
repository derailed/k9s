## ðŸŽ…ðŸŽ„ !!Merry Christmas To All!! ðŸŽ„ðŸŽ…

I hope you will take this time of the year to relax, re-source and spend quality time with your loved ones. I know it's been a `tad rocky` of recent ;( as I've gotten seriously slammed with work in the last few months...
The fine folks here on this channel have been nothing but kind, patient and willing to help, this humbles me! I feel truly blessed to be affiliated with our great `k9sers` community!
Next month, we'll celebrate our anniversary as we've started out in this venture back in Jan 2019 (Yikes!) so get crack'in and iron out those bow ties already!!

Best wishes for great health, happiness and continued success for 2022 to you all!!

## A Christmas Story...

As of this drop, we've added a new feature to override the sort column and order for a given Kubernetes resource. This feature piggy backs of custom column views and add a new attribute namely `sortColumn`. For example say you'd like to set the default sort for pods to age descending vs name/namespace, you can now do the following in your `views.yml` file in the k9s config directory:

NOTE: This file is live thus you can nav to your fav resource, change the column config and view the resource columns and sort changes... Woot!!

```yaml
k9s:
  views:
    v1/endpoints:
      columns:
        - NAME
        - NAMESPACE
        - ENDPOINTS
        - AGE
    v1/pods:
      sortColumn: AGE:desc  # => suffix [:asc|:desc] for ascending or descending order.
    v1/services:
      ...
```
