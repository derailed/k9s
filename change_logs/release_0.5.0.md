## Change Logs

I am super excited about this drop of K9s. Lots of cool improvements based on K9s friends excellent feedback!


### Popeye

Turns out [Popeye](https://github.com/derailed/popeye) is in too much flux at present, thus I've decided to remove it from K9s for the time being.

### ContainerView

Added a container view to list all the containers available on a given pod. On a selected pod, you can now press `<enter>` to view all of it's associated containers. Once in container view pressing `<enter>` on a selected container, will show the container logs.

### Resource Traversals

> Ever wanted to know where your pods originated from?

Fear not, K9s has got your back! Some folks have expressed desires to navigate from a deployment to its pods or see which pods are running on a given node. Whether you are starting from a Node, a Deployment, ReplicaSet, DaemonSet or StatefulSet, you can now simply `<enter>` of a selected item a view the associated pods. [Issue #149](https://github.com/derailed/k9s/issues/149)

### RollingBack ReplicaSets

You can now select a ReplicaSet and rollback your Deployment to that version. Enter the command mode via `:rs` to view ReplicaSets, select the replica you want to rollback to and use `Ctrl-B` to rollback your deployment to that revision.
