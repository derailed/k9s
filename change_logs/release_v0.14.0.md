## Happy Birthday K9s!!

üéâü•≥üéä Doh! Almost missed it... üéâü•≥üéä

 Yes sir, it's been a year (already...) since K9s was first launched üéâ. I can't tell you what a year this has been üôÄ. Difficult? sure. However, you guys are making this project a total gas, by your candor, kindness and for giving back via your creative issues, prs, sponsorships, slack channel help to name a few... I do think, you've all been all too quiet tho üê≠... So if K9s helps make your K8s life bett'a on a day to day basis, please reach out for your shoe-phones and dial up [@kitesurfer](https://twitter.com/kitesurfer) or write an article/blog and share it! Lastly I am so humbled by this... but we're closing on 5k stars/136k downloads in this repo, so please invite 28 of your closest friends soon...

Major Thanks to all of you for you patience and for making this project a reality to all our K8s friends! You're all redefining awesomeness!!

Also I'd like to take this opportunity to recognize and thank a few folks that have willingly volunteered their own time to track down issues and help improve K9s for all of us!!

## Search Enabled For Describe/YAML views

In this drop we made the Describe/YAML views searchable. So you no longer need to plow thru your resource configurations and get directly to the just of it by using the search command ie `/elvis` + `enter`. You can use the familiar keys `n` and `N` to nav back and forth to the next occurrence in a circular buffer fashion once you've reached the BOF/EOF. It's the little things in life...
