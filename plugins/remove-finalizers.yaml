# Removes all finalizers from the selected resource. Finalizers are namespaced keys that tell Kubernetes to wait
# until specific conditions are met before it fully deletes resources marked for deletion.
# Before deleting an object you need to ensure that all finalizers has been removed. Usually this would be done
# by the specific controller but under some circumstances it is possible to encounter a set of objects blocked
# for deletion.
# This plugins makes this task easier by providing a shortcut to directly removing them all.
# Be careful when using this plugin as it may leave dangling resources or instantly deleting resources that were
# blocked by the finalizers.
